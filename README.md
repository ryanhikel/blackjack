# Ryan Hikel Unit One Project: BlackJack

Link to live game: https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/hikelryan/unit-one-project/index.html

Technologies used:
Ive used jQuery for dom selection along with HTML and CSS to display my game. I created the dealers logic through the use of JavaScript which also is used in the functions for creating/ shuffling the deck as well as dealing cards to both the player and dealer. I also used the site Animista for the animation that slid in the cards.

Approach taken:
My original plan was to push the cards directly onto the page and calculate the totals based on that. I had problems with that method and thanks to some help from the instructors I changed my method to using objects to store most of my data and do all the work in Javascript.

Challenges:
One of the biggest ongoing problems I have had was toggling the value of the ace which was supposed to be equal to 1 or 11 depending on the total value I ended up trying several different functions to accomplish this and I believe it is working now. 

Unsolved problems:
One issue that caused me more trouble than I expected was the CSS. I found that using flexbox was not as clear to me as I originally thought and I needed to look up more on it but I was still unable to make everything stay where it was supposed to when objects were added or removed. Looking at other projects I wonder if I should have attempted to reset my CSS prior to applying any flexbox. Another challenge I had that I was unable to solve was flipping the dealers card over with a css animation. I used another animation from Animista however no matter how I applied it the card would flip upside down.

I would definitely like more time on this project to learn from my mistakes and improve on every aspect as I become more comfortable with it. Id also like to try to remake the game in pure JavaScript since I need practice.
